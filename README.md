# An Abstracted Simulation of Compassionate Judgement and Action
A computer simulation of compassionate action in a collection of individuals.

Compassion is a normative judgement of the difference between biological beings that can reach a goal and those that cannot.  If computers are to fit with prosocial goals, they should be able to make these judgements, particularly as artificial intelligence advances.

This is a simple simulation of compassionate helping in a computer, using arrays of values as goals, and data points as agents to be compassionate towards.  Because the model cannot choose its own task, compassionate helping was chosen for it.  The challenge, though, is not the normative judging involved in compassion, but rather simulating how and when to allocate help as a resource.

I will program complications that affect the simulated goal-reaching to increase believability, and as a point of comparison with the studentsâ€™ problem-solving abilities, given a complication in their attempts to help.
